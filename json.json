"Most of my career has been in construction management. I&#x27;m soon interviewing with a slightly related SaaS company
who I would classify as a startup. This isn&#x27;t a world that I have any experience in, what things should I be
considering and aware of?", "time": 1639951350, "url": null, "by": "spacebouy"}, {"id": 29618773, "title": "Ask HN: Is
data collection the intended purpose of 'security questions'?", "type": "story", "text": "Security questions seem to
fall into two categories. Either easily researched information &quot;what is your mother&#x27;s maiden name?&quot; or
something that &quot;only you&quot; would know. The problem with the first category should be obvious, and as for the
second &quot;What is your favorite flavor of ice cream?&quot; &quot;vanilla&quot; is the equivalent of using a single
dictionary word (from a very limited dictionary) as a password, and probably using the same single dictionary word as a
password on multiple sites at that.<p>It seems to be fairly commonplace for people to answer them with gibberish to
	avoid the aforementioned problems, and (most? all?) websites will override them if you claim you don&#x27;t remember
	what answers you gave. This appears to do nothing to make my account more secure, it just makes me want to avoid
	using your service.<p>So, for people who have implemented &#x27;security&#x27; questions as a form of
		authentication, what purpose do you think they serve? Are the answers being sold? Is it just theater because you
		think it will make your users feel safer? Is there some other benefit to collecting this seemingly unnecessary
		data on your customers and storing it in plaintext that I&#x27;m failing to recognize?", "time": 1639950611,
