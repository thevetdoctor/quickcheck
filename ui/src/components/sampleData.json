      "text": "Bribery is a problem that&#x27;s not limited to cryptocurrency (and has almost nothing to do with Web 3).  The way to tackle bribery, in a society where it has become endemic, is to have an independent commission tasked with carrying out sting operations and financial investigations against targets they have received anonymous tips about.  Volunteers can be given small rewards and temporary immunity for taking part in the sting operations, or whistleblowing undisclosed assets.<p>To answer the obvious questions:<p>* What if the commission itself is corrupt?  The finances of its members (and their families) should be public documents, and their pay &#x2F; budget should be modest (to attract only people who care about the problem, perhaps retired school teachers, or people seconded from a foreign government with a good reputation).<p>* What if the commission is politically biased?  It should be given quotas for the party affiliation and level of seniority of the targets.  For example, if a senator from one major party is convicted, then a senator from another major party must be convicted before the first party is targeted again.  To prove good faith, the party that introduces this commission should set the quota such that their own party is subject to more scrutiny.<p>* Why would a politician introduce a system that limits their own corruption?  Firstly, because it will win them votes, and secondly, they can limit the commission to tackling corruption in local politics (and small businesses) in their first term, then tackle regional politics (and medium businesses) in the second term, then national politics (and big businesses) in a third (possibly their successor&#x27;s) term, by which time the national politicians should have seen the writing on the wall and retired with their ill-gotten gains.",

Before forwarding this issue to my lawyer and notifying my local data privacy authority, I want to try my luck here.<p>The issue is that it is impossible to delete Google Calendar entries permanently. Even if not visible in the Calendar (and dust bin) anymore, those entries are still visible in Google Takeout with the status &quot;CANCELLED&quot;.<p>How to reproduce:\n1. Create a calendar entry\n2. Delete that calendar entry\n3. Empty the dust bin\n4. Download your Google Calendar entry via Google Takeout\n5. The calendar entry is still visible, so it must be stored on Google servers still.<p>I tried contact the support multiple times and also asked them to escalate this case, which was done. But in the end I always receive a generic answer that I should delete my cookies and cache and try again. If that does not work, I should fill out the Google Takeout feedback form.<p>Has someone else had the same issue? How should I proceed to get my data deleted?",

However, I would like to understand this a bit deeper to know what to expect for the rest of my life.<p>Are we saying that people who only get their first or second jab now are essentially very very little to nothing protected against Omicron until they get their third one? If they do have protection after a recent 1st or 2nd then are we saying that the jab count doesn&#x27;t really matter and it&#x27;s about time? Does it mean the mRNA vaccines only seem to work for about 3-4 months after the jab and then fade very rapidly? So we will need a 4th, then 5th, etc.?<p>I read not long ago that Israel is already preparing for a 4th vaccine rollout which would kind of support that idea.<p>Which one is it and what does that mean for the future?",

      "text": "Hi HN, thanks for reading this.<p>I&#x27;m in Italy now and really need to learn the language fast. I had a lot of success in Mexico learning Spanish, but I had a lot of help from an online course called &quot;Spanish with Paul&quot;.<p>This course in Spanish just put me on a very fast track to learning because of the order that it presented information, where you essentially start speaking right away, and you&#x27;re constantly being drilled with more and more complicated sentences, as you introduce new grammar.<p>This was a system that worked extremely well for me, but unfortunately I have not found anything similar for Italian - like a good blend being comprehensive AND practical. There are many courses that are kind of gimmicky, which is fine and I appreciate them, but I&#x27;m really looking for something that I can spend 2-3 hours a day in focused study&#x2F;practice that also lets me start building upon the daily practice I get from just living here.<p>I was planning on basically building my own version of the course I mentioned above, &quot;Spanish with Paul&quot;, by essentially just translating the same concepts over, however very early on I encountered concepts that don&#x27;t exist in Spanish at all, for very simply constructs. E.g.:<p>eng: I want \\ \nesp: quiero \\ \nita: voglio \\<p>(ok, simple)<p>eng: I want it \\\nesp: lo quiero \\ \nita: lo voglio \\<p>(So far so good, perfectly smooth sailing)<p>eng: I need \\ \nesp: necesito \\ \nita: ho bisogno \\<p>(Ok, this &#x27;ho&#x27; is acting like &#x27;haber&#x27; in Spanish... I know this, not the end of the world...)<p>eng: I need it \\ \nesp: lo necesito \\ \nita: ne ho bisogno \\<p>(wtf... then I look up &#x27;ne&#x27; and I am introduced at step 0. to the world of Italian pronouns and my face melts)<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a temporary road block and in the future if I read a similar post to this I&#x27;ll have great advice, but for the time being I&#x27;m in that awkward phase where I really feel like I&#x27;m wasting time by not doing focused studying because I&#x27;m chasing various rabbit holes.<p>So, something a little more curated would be great, and maybe I could eventually make that &quot;course&quot; I was talking about. Any help, would be very appreciated. My secret weapon with learning Spanish was really just studying a lot and practicing, and not wasting time doing other stuff.<p>Thank you!",

I went to check out with deliver set to a Locker close by but it was $7.75. If I changed deliver to my home address it was free. The shoes were $50, I don&#x27;t have Prime. I have ordered before to a Locker and didn&#x27;t cost extra.<p>Can anyone think of a reason for this? Maybe Lockers are hitting capacity because of the holidays? I figured Lockers might be cheaper for Amazon to deliver to than individual addresses, but maybe the real estate costs outweigh the deliver costs?

      "text": "This is a contentious issue in the industry. The following is highly opinionated. If you have a strong opinion on it, please engage constructively in the comments. Don&#x27;t downvote others who may have a different view.<p>tl;dr:\n- One of the benefits of open source code is that large companies can share in the benefits of transferable knowledge\n- Compensation is not influenced as much by individual skills or replacement costs as popular knowledge suggests, it is set at a macro level\n- College towns and industry hotspots get higher wages so as to attract the expert competition as well as apply move pressure from outside nations so the local talent there doesn&#x27;t create the next big thing\n- Improving the funding prospects for large successful projects creates power centers outside of the traditional commercial software industry which creates the &quot;wrong&quot; incentive&quot; for high performing talent to work outside the FAANG+ structure and potentially undermine them.<p>The longer form:-&gt;<p>*The Industry reaction to Log4j* : I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of really intelligent senior people at large firms in the Bay Area react rather strangely to the ongoing Log4j bug. The developers behind the logging library themselves were sadly under the pump and receiving some pretty bad &quot;feedback&quot; on twitter and elsewhere while trying to figure out a fix for the issue.<p>The general tone of people who are director level or above in the industry seems to be that this is &quot;Not an open source funding issue at all&quot; and that &quot;This issue could not have been prevented if the devs maintaining the code were paid&quot;. . .well, hang on a minute.<p>This reduces the argument to a rather foolish strawman where we&#x27;re supposed to debate the benefits of paying a salary to one or more devs. This is not what anyone means by Open Source Funding. A significant portion of software developers&#x27; compensation in the industry is tied to variable financial products such as restricted stock units or profit sharing&#x2F;ownership agreements in the case of firms not listed on the public markets yet.<p>The large firms also make available to their devs, armies of lawyers, PR professionals, QA, testing and operations folk to help manage situations such as the one we&#x27;re witnessing playing out with Log4j. All of constitutes compensation &quot;In Kind&quot; . .. the free food, the insurance, the laundry, everything that acts as a safety net backstop to allow the developers at these large firms the luxury of not having to sweat the trivial and instead focus on what they do best.<p>*Compensation as a mechanism to exert move pressure* : Compensation in the industry is decided more at a &quot;Macro&quot; level rather than something that&#x27;s directly a factor of an individuals contribution or skills. What this means is, it is a mechanism the industry uses to  price the value they place on a combination of : Location, desire to reinforce competitive concentrations of skill levels next to each other, desire to reduce the incentives to directly compete through an entrepreneurial undertaking instead of employment and others.<p>In short, there is very little leverage a regular individual developer who is not an outlier can exert on compensation ranges. These decisions are made strategically by multi national corporations to make it a desirable career move to move to the Bay Area or other such locations that these companies continue to have a strong presence in.<p>*How Open Source is placed if this scenario were true* : Clearly, companies that have invested in making sure that the talent that can build things that can compete with them are not going to make it easier for that talent to do so while paying their bills and luxuries, allowing them the same worry free experience they may expect as employees. Using open source libraries is necessary to avoid closed kingdoms that devs would not want to work in as it may kill their careers.",

      "text": "rct AI, the provider of AI solutions for the video game industry based off LA, has announced completion of $10M+ Series A-3 funding led by Yuanyuzhou Ventures and Springwind Ventures.<p>rct AI is a tech-driven project that builds the true Metaverse with AI-generated content for gaming and blockchain. Since establishment in 2018, they have partnered with 20+ game studios and served 200M+ users worldwide. In this round, they raised funds from Yuanyuzhou Ventures, Springwind Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Bonfire Union, Everest Ventures Group, FBG Capital, Folius Ventures, Hash Global, HashKey Capital, Mr. Liang Xinjun (co-founder of Fosun Group), Lucid Blue Ventures, Mask Network, PKSHA SPARX Algorithm Fund, SNZ, and Zonff Partners — powerful VCs from the US, China, Japan, etc. countries &amp; regions very active in gaming, AI, and blockchain.<p>They attracted the attention of the mainstream media and were chosen a TechCrunch favorite startup. The unconventional vision helped rct AI raise funds from acclaimed investment institutions. Sky Saga Capital and Y Combinator led two of their Seed rounds, while Makers Fund and Galaxy Interactive led the two previous Series A round.<p>One of rct AI’s core products is Deterrence, the world’s first AI layer powering intelligent NFTs. Deterrence is integrated with AI conversation models, AI intent recognition, and AI motion generation to create cognitively aware virtual beings.<p>According to rct AI, now each intelligent NPC and virtual being can sense state changes in digital environments. Thus, player interactions are no longer limited to fixed and repetitive dialogues and choices. The innovation does not end here, since together with AI-to-earn (AI yield farming), Deterrence opens new possibilities for all play-to-earn games.<p>Cutting-edge is the second name of rct AI. They developed the world’s first AAA play-to-earn game and the NPC response and storyline generator Morpheus AI engine backed by the Chaos Box algorithm, which is connected and empowered by Deterrence to provides AI utility and experience to all users.<p>Besides the gamefi automated yield framing, these include higher liquidity of NFTs and higher revenue for NFT owners. NFTs are another key area of interest and business expansion for rct AI.<p>They developed the world’s first intelligent NFT and a series of boutique play-to-earn games. Intelligent NFTs are designed using the world’s first intelligent NFT chip, a standardized product powered by Deterrence that helps individual creators and teams build all kinds of high-quality and life-like intelligent virtual beings and creatures. rct’s first collection of intelligent tokens called Mirror NFT opened the boutique gamefi project Mirror World which helped rct AI find partners among notable blockchain projects and communities. As of now, Mirror NFT owners have performed millions of transactions with their tokens.<p>rct AI CEO Yuheng Chen stated “What lies ahead of us is an unprecedented endeavor in human history. As we live together with truly intelligent virtual beings and intelligent NFTs to move forward and develop the vast and multitudinous Metaverse, we are also refreshing our understanding and knowledge of life itself.”",
